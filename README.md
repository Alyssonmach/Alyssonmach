He has completed high school at Colégio Alfredo Dantas (CAD) and is currently graduating in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). He won the Golden Lion (Award offered by CAD for outstanding students) in High School as an award for better performance in grades, receiving second and first place in the last years of high school, respectively. He developed a project entitled "Linear Algebra with Python", aiming to apply Concepts of Linear Algebra Computationally. He is currently active in the development of ideas and applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in search of developing solid knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and more specifically in Convolutional Neural Networks. He has experience in developing web pages, programming in C, C ++, Python and versioning projects with Git. Developed activities relevant to the academic community such as the "Academic Talk" event in partnership with the UFCG PELS / IAS chapter associated with the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). This project aims to develop relevant skills for undergraduate students in relation to the professional market, academic project opportunities, research development and student exchange.
